TODO: (assuming simple algorithm of reading pixel values)

- Resize to uniform nxn (so all feature vectors are the same) 
	* Preserve aspect ratio, just fill in extra pixels to make square

- Make ~20 training examples with noise, ~10 testing examples with noise
	* Train SVM, test, record error

- Start iterating over algorithm types, comparing accuracy 
	* Something to look into: Histogram of Oriented Gradients
